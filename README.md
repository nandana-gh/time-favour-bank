Project Description
HourBank is a community service exchange platform where people can trade skills and services without using money. The platform uses time credits as currency, where users can offer or request services, and the time they spend or receive is tracked and exchanged for other services.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wished you could get help with something without spending a dime? Got a skill but don't know how to exchange it? People arenâ€™t helping others enough. Weâ€™ll change that, but in the quirkiest way possible â€“ time trading!

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Weâ€™re solving this "serious" issue by creating a platform where time is currency, and everyoneâ€™s an expert! Offering help to fix a faucet? Great, hereâ€™s an hour. Need help with coding? Use those earned time credits to get it. Welcome to the barter system of the future!
