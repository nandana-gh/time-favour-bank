# TimeBank - Community Service Exchange Platform

TimeBank is a community service exchange platform where people can trade skills and services without using money. The platform uses time credits as currency. Users can offer or request services, and the time they spend or receive is tracked as time credits, which can be exchanged for other services.

- **Time Credits**: One hour of service equals one time credit, regardless of the service provided.
- **Service Listings**: Users can search and browse available services in the community.
- **Service Requests**: Users can post service requests or offer services in exchange for time credits.
- **Messaging**: Real-time communication between users.
- **Scheduling**: Users can schedule time for service exchanges.
